# flowroute-numbers-ruby
## What is it?

Flowroute-numbers-ruby is a ruby API Wrapper that provides methods for interacting with [Flowroute's](https://www.flowroute.com) v1 API. These methods can be used to accomplish the following:

* Search for purchasable phone numbers
* Purchase phone numbers
* View your owned phone numbers and their related details
* Create new inbound routes
* Update the primary and failover route on a phone number

## Documentation 
The full documentation for Flowroute's v1 API is available at [Developer.flowroute.com](https://developer.flowroute.com/).

## How To Install 

The SDK uses the UniRest ruby library, which will need to be installed before you can use the SDK. To install this package, open a terminal session and execute the following commands

	cd flowroute-numbers-ruby/
	gem build flowroute_numbers.gemspec
	gem install flowroute_numbers-1.0.gem

> Note: You will need to be connected to the internet in order to install the required packages
  
## How To Get Setup

The following shows how to import the SDK and setup your API credentials.

1) Import the SDK module:

	require 'flowroute_numbers'

> Depending on your file system structure, you may need to explicitly state the location of the flowroute_numbers SDK.       
   
2) Configure your API Username and Password from [Flowroute Manager](https://manage.flowroute.com/accounts/preferences/api/).
 > If you do not have an API Key contact support@flowroute.com:

	FlowrouteNumbers::Configuration.username = 'AccessKey'
	FlowrouteNumbers::Configuration.password = 'SecretKey'
	
> These variables can also be hard coded in the Configuration.rb file instead of being overwritten in code. If you go this route, you will need to rebuild the gem and install the new gem.

3) Instantiate your controllers for later use

	pnc = FlowrouteNumbers::PurchasablePhoneNumbersController.new()
	tnc = FlowrouteNumbers::TelephoneNumbersController.new()
	irc = FlowrouteNumbers::InboundRoutesController.new()     
	
> If you do not want to assign variable names to the controllers and pass your credentials to each controller, you can just hard code the credentials in Configuration.php and call each controller by its full name.
